# IIoT_predictive_maintenance

## General Information About The Project
- **Development Environment:** The project is developed in Python and structured as Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Objective:** The primary objective of this project is to implement predictive maintenance for a milling machine using Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) data.
- **Dataset:** The project leverages a dataset collected from sensors and machine logs. This dataset aims to predict when maintenance is required to prevent unexpected breakdowns.
               This dataset was taken from UCI machine learning repository [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset****].

- **Project Goal:** The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can utilize real-time sensor data from the milling machine, based on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology.                      The model aims to forecast maintenance needs and identify potential types of failures associated with the milling machine.
